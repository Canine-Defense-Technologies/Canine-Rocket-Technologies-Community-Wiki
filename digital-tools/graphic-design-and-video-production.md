# Graphic Design & Video Production

## Introduction&#x20;

Graphic design is often the overlooked part of projects like ours. Let's be honest, if your cool project has a crappy logo or graphic, it isn't very presentable. The same applies to videos, they serve as the moving digital face of your project! Honestly, we sometimes go overkill on our videos, but who doesn't want to watch a beautifully produced video? Learning some of this software we found helpful below are extremely useful skills! We like to treat our videos and graphics as an integral part of the project, and it really helps take things to the next level.

## Inkscape

Inkscape is a fully open sourced free-to-use graphic design software suite. The capabilities of the software are astonishing, however, we ourselves admittedly have not learned most of the functions (lol). That leads us to the primary downside, its UI is confusing and a bit intimating, however, we are well aware of its powers from even basic use.

Not recommended for new users! The UI can be overwhelming

## Shotcut

Shotcut is not the best nor most feature-rich video editing software out there, but it gets the job done! We love that it's free and open-sourced with a decently large helpful community base. Fun fact, all our videos are edited in it!

{% hint style="warning" %}
We have found Shotcut to be glitchy, especially after updates! To prevent lost projects save often!

## Stickermule Tools

Stickermule offers free browser-based tools for simple graphic editing! Stickermule Studio has been a really great tool for creating graphics in a rush on the go for us personally. The background remover and upscale tool is also really handy for general use (in our experience it works better than some of the graphics tools we use every day!).&#x20;
