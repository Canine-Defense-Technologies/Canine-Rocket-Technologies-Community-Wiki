# üê∫ Welcome to the Wiki!

Welcome to the Canine Rocket Technologies Community Wiki! This platform serves as our dedicated documentation hub to accelerate development in collaborative projects, provide the public with experience-proven information, and assist with our open source project management.&#x20;



### How does the Wiki Differ from K-Tech's other platforms?

Most of our community members have found us via 3rd party platforms such as YouTube or Hackaday.io . These sites are more or less for sharing projects and the associated files. The wiki is more focused on managing and documenting every aspect of our projects from the R\&D process to the finished projects. Think about it this way, this is a place where we dump our knowledge in an organized pretty UI for you (and our team) to easily access!&#x20;
