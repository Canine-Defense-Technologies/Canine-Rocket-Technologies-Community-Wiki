## Introduction

Welcome to the Canine Rocket Technologies Wiki, our resource hub for all our projects

Most of the community has found us through Twitter, YouTube, or Hackaday.io. The wiki is more focused on managing and documenting our projects and resources in more detail in a more centralized hub to make it easier for users to find the information they need, and simplify collaborative projects.&#x20;

Learn more about our management structure:
