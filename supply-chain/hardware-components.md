# Hardware Components

## McMaster Carr

McMaster Carr is an industry-trusted hardware and tooling supplier. They are a dependable supplier with good customer service and extremely speedy delivery. Their huge selection of parts, specs (even have nuclear reactor grade stuff no joke), and super fast turnaround (order to door in 24 hours in some cases) make them an ideal choice for purchasing critical components during development. The convenience comes at a cost though, McMaster Carr seemed to be on the more expensive end in our experience, while some more specialty components cost much more than other suppliers. However, if certain critical part specs are critical for a project, McMaster Carr is a reputable supplier you can trust.&#x20;
