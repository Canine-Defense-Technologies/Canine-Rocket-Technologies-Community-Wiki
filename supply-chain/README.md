# ðŸšš Supply Chain

## Introduction

Welcome to the Supply Chain! This is a library of the suppliers we primarily use to source parts and outsource manufacturing! We have included our own thoughts from working with each company, along with tips to help you find the right supplier for you!

{% hint style="warning" %}
We are not affiliated with, sponsored from, or endorsing any of the listed suppliers!

## Layout

Each supplier or manufacturer is divided into categories by what services or parts they provide (Electronics, hardware components, etc.). Each section will then have some of our thoughts about them based on our experience along with the link to each company. Note that the same companies may be in multiple categories, this is to help with differentiating experiences based on what service or parts were purchased from the company. For example, if one company did great providing electronic parts but had horrible 3D printing services, it is much easier to read about each different experience in each category instead&#x20;
