# PCB Frabrication

## Oshpark

oshpark is our favorite PCB fabrication companies. Based in the USA they offer very high quality PCBs are a fair price. They are a little slower and more expensive than the other companies listed on this page, but it's well worth the wait and extra cost for the quality of the boards. For our most important PCBs, we order from Oshpark. Our only complaint is they do not grind off the tags from the panelization process, so you will need to manually sand them off.

## JLCPCB

JLCPCB is a very low cost PCB manufacturing company. In our experience both the manufacturing and customer service were great to handle with. The PCB fabircation time is some of the fastest we've seen, but shippment can be unreliable at times. The PCB Quality is decent and good enough for the majoritiy of projects, though it isn't exactly premium. Small graphics on the silkscreen may be a little off and the edge finishes aren't always the best in our experience.
