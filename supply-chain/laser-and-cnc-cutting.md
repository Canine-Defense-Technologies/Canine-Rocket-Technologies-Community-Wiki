# Laser and CNC Cutting

## Send Cut Send

Send Cut Send is an amazing laser cutting, metal bending, and water jet service based in Nevada. Their prices are fair and they have a diverse selection of materials to choose from. Their turnaround time is about a week, though if you ordered post processing services such as powder coating this can be extended to 2 weeks. We were very impressed by the quality and price of their parts and highly recommend them!&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Their minimum order price starts at $29. Share an order with friends or multiple projects to get an overall better price!
