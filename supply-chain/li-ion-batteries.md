# Li Ion Batteries

{% hint style="danger" %}
Buying Li-Ion cells from non-reputable sellers can be dangerous! Often times cheaper prices or near-impossible technical specs are strong indicators that the cells being sold are counterfeit!&#x20;

## Battery Hookups

Battery Hookups is currently the only company we trust to purchase Li-Ion cells secondhand. They purchase old or almost new cells in bulk and resell them after testing them at cheaper prices. You can often get very good deals on rather expensive cells, and sometimes come across exotic batteries you can't purchase anywhere else. Their stock isn't consistent since they're a reseller, but if you keep an eye there are always good finds. The conditions of the cells aren't always new, and they're honest about notifying you about their test results and assessments do you can make the right choices. They hold a good reputation in the DIY battery community and our own very positive experience

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you're new to DIY Li-Ion battery builds, we would still highly recommend you to start out with brand new reputable cells. Buying used cells, even ones from reputable resellers like Battery Hookups requires basic technical understanding.&#x20;
