# Electronics

## Introduction

Electronics is what brings many projects alive, quite literally. Since this is such a diverse area, we will break it down into the context of tools and skills relevant to common small projects the majority of makers will encounter. Yes, high amperage vehicle power systems, high voltage AC, and microcontrollers, we've done it all but. Remember messing with electronics is one of the biggest killers among young makers, start small and do your research!

#### Where Do I Learn Electronics?

It really depends on what you want to do.&#x20;

## Safety

{% hint style="danger" %}
Know your limits, and do not go beyond with electronics!
{% endhint %}

#### Heat

Most&#x20;

#### Electrical Shocks

In small electronics, small shocks are not a very big problem. However, as projects get bigger, high-voltage capacitors, power supplies, and components can literally KILL you! Make sure you do your research, and never push yourself beyond your comfort zone. One of the best ways to get into high-voltage electronics is to take guidance from someone who is already experienced.

#### Toxic Fumes

Contrary to popular belief, solder fumes are not lead fumes. They are however chemical fumes from the infused flux and other additives that are VERY bad for you. Lead-free solder will often have more fumes&#x20;

Venting out the fumes or running it through an air filtration system **designed to filter out solder fumes** ( NOT air purifiers or uncertified knockoffs) is a MUST to prevent respiratory damage and cancer.&#x20;

Dealing with High Voltage or High Current devices can kill or injure you. Ensure you seek guidance from a qualified individual and utilize proper safety equipment and measures!

#### Lead Poisoning

Solder contains lead, and we all know what happened to people during the days of lead pipes ðŸ™ƒ! Often around electronic solder workstations, you will notice a lot of lead particulates that splash off your workpiece building up on surfaces around you. We recommend having something such as a vacuum to clean up these particulates frequently. Do not have food or drinks near your electronic workstations (I'm talking about you EEs who drink coffee while soldering) and wash your hands thoroughly after handling electronics and soldering. &#x20;

## EDA

Electronic Design Automation is where all Printed Circuit Board (PCB) projects start.&#x20;

### Easy EDA

Easy EDA is a free and open-sourced web browser-based EDA software under the JLCPCB and LCSC's ecosystem (More info on [here](../supply-chain/electronics-component.md#lcsc)). This makes designing and ordering the parts with their services extremely streamlined and easy. However, this also means if one would like to purchase components from other suppliers such as digikey, a lot of the automatic features and libraries may not be accessible.&#x20;

## Microcontroller

Microcontrollers are the heart of many of our small projects, in fact, they are the heart of many of our appliances and tools all around us everyday! Learning the basics of microcontrollers is a extremely helpful skill
