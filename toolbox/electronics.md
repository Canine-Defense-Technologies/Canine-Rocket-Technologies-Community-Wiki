# Electronics

Electronics is what brings many projects alive, quite literally. Since this is such a diverse area, we will break it down into the context of tools and skills relevant to common small projects the majority of makers will encounter. Yes, high amperage vehicle power systems, high voltage AC, and microcontrollers, we've done it all but. Remember messing with electronics is one of the biggest killers among young makers, start small and do your research!

#### Where Do I Learn Electronics?

It really depends on what you want to do.&#x20;

## Safety

Heat: Your melting solder, there will obviously be a lot of heat involved.&#x20;

Electrical Shocks: In small electornics, small shocks are not a very big problem. However as projects get bigger, high voltage capacirots, power supplies, and components could cause isn

Toxic Fumes:

## EDA

Electronic Design Automation is where all Printed Circuit Board (PCB) projects start.&#x20;

### Easy EDA

Easy EDA a free and open sourced web browser based EDA software under the JLCPCB and LCSC's ecosystem (More info on [here](../supply-chain/electronics-component.md#lcsc)). This makes designing and ordering the parts with their services extremely streamlined and easy. However this also means if one would like to purchase components from other suppliers such as digikey, a lot of the automatic features and libraries may not be accessible.&#x20;

Pros:

* Completely free with tons of options
* Simple easy to use and non intimidating UI
* Large Open Source Community base/support
* Streamlined&#x20;

## Microcontroller

Microcontrollers are the heart of many of our small projects, in fact they are the heart many of our appliances and tools all around us everyday! Learning the basics of microcontrollers is a extremely helpful skill
