## EDA

Electronic Design Automation is where all Printed Circuit Board (PCB) projects start.&#x20;

### Easy EDA

Easy EDA a free and open sourced web browser based EDA software under the JLCPCB and LCSC's ecosystem (More info on [here](../supply-chain/electronics-component.md#lcsc)). This makes designing and ordering the parts with their services extremely streamlined and easy. However this also means if one would like to purchase components from other suppliers such as digikey, a lot of the automatic features and libraries may not be accessible.&#x20;

Pros:

* Completely free with tons of options
* Simple easy to use and non intimidating UI
* Large Open Source Community base/support
* Streamlined&#x20;
