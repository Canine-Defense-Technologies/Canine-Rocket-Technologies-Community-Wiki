# Graphic Design & Video Production

Graphic design is often the overlooked part of projects like ours. Let's be honest, if your cool project has a crappy logo or graphic, it doesn't look very presentable. The same applies to videos, they serve as the moving digital face of your project! Honestly we sometimes go overkill on our videos, but who doesn't want to watcha beautifully produced video! Learning some of these software we found helpful below are extremely useful skills!

## Inkscape

Inkscape is a fully open sourced free to use graphic design software suite. The capabilities of the software is astonishing, however we ourselves admittedly have not learned most of the functions (lol). That leads us to the primary downside, it's UI is confusing and a bit intimating, however we are well aware of its powers from even basic use.
