# Laser Cutting

In our opinion laser cutting is an underrated manufacturing process. Laser cutters allow precision cutting on two dimensional surfaces extremely quickly. Unlike CNCs since your burning your way through, no bits or tooling is needed. If you have experience with a 3D printer of CNC, laser cutters are extremely easy to get started in!

#### When Should I Use  a Laser Cutter?

Anything that requires cutting of flat materials, laser cutters are the way to go. However make sure you do your own research on which materials work, and which ones don't. We often utilize laser cutters often in our prototyping stage to make rapid try in parts. It's faster and cheaper than 3D printing, and its extremely easy to use.&#x20;
