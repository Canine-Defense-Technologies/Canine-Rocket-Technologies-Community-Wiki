# Laser Cutting

In our opinion laser cutting is an underrated manufacturing process. Laser cutters allow precision cutting on two dimensional surfaces. Laser cutting is fast and cheap, with the only major downside being the limitations of materials and the toxic fumes it produces. If you have experience with a 3D printer of CNC, laser cutters are extremely easy to get started in
