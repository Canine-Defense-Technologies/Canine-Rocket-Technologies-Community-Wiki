# Laser Cutting

In our opinion laser cutting is an underrated manufacturing process. Laser cutters allow precision cutting on two-dimensional surfaces extremely quickly. Unlike CNCs since you are burning your way through, no bits or tooling is needed. If you have experience with a 3D printer of CNC, laser cutters are extremely easy to get started in!

#### When Should I Use a Laser Cutter?

For anything that requires cutting flat materials, laser cutters are the way to go. However make sure you do your own research on which materials work, and which ones don't. We often utilize laser cutters often in our prototyping stage to make a rapid try in parts. It's faster and cheaper than 3D printing, and it's extremely easy to use.&#x20;

#### Disadvantages of Laser Cutters:

The biggest deal breaker with the laser cutters in our opinion is managing the toxic fumes and the safety hazard of the laser beam. It only takes a brief accident to go completely blind if used irresponsibly, and this can be intimidating to new users. Not only that the fumes it produces are often toxic and require extremely adequate ventilation. Laser cutters also have two big limitations in terms of operations performance. For one unlike CNC which can practically cut through anything, lasers have limitations on what materials they can cut, and even the color and how transparent the material is. The second limitation is the divergence of the laser beam, on thicker material a sort of cone effect on the cut is obvious from the divergence of the laser as the cut gets further away from the focal point.&#x20;

## Safety

Because of simply how easily and quickly improper usage of lasers can blind you, we would say it is one of the most dangerous tools in any workshop.&#x20;

Lasers can PERMANENTLY BLIND YOU! Make sure to always wear certified laser goggles of the proper spec when operating a laser, and do it in an area where no person or animal can be harmed from ANY stray laser light
