# Software Dev

Software is how our projects come alive. We're focusing on developing hardware not software, so don't take any coding or workstation tips from us. Below are simply the ecosystems we utilize for viewing data, basic debugging, and loading software.&#x20;



## IDE

### Arduino IDE

Anything microcontroller related can usually be done with the Arduino IDE. It's a really great software ecosystem, and the new software update really makes it look cleaner and more appealing for new users!&#x20;

### Arduino Web Editor

The free version has limits on h ow many times you can flash the code onto a board, but still a great platform for making adjustments on a go! It's saved some of our projects while we were gone from the lab multiple times already.

### Python

You will come across the popular python ecosystem in one format or the other. Python is well supported and well maintained. It is also utilized by many other open source projects, especially those utilizing raspberry pis.&#x20;
