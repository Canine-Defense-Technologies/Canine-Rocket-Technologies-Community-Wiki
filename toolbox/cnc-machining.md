# CNC Machining

Computer Numerical Control Machining or CNC is a method of automated machining through computer-controlled tools. CNC Machining is what we call Subtractive Manufacturing, where parts are cut out of larger blocks of material. This is fundamentally a wasteful and time-consuming process hence the high costs.

#### When Should I Use CNC Machining?

Though CNC machining is neither the most efficient nor elegant manufacturing process, it often yields extremely strong consistent parts compared to other novel manufacturing processes such as 3D printing. We often try to avoid CNC machining due to the time and cost, but when part reliability and strength are critical, it's often the best manufacturing method to go with.&#x20;

#### Disadvantaged of CNC Machining

Typically budgetary and time constraints along with part geometry will be the determining factor as to whether CNC machining a part is feasible. Much like how some part geometries simply must be designed in certain ways to be 3D printed, the same applies to CNC machined parts but with even greater restrictions. Anyone mildly experienced with CNC machining will realize how simple additions of features in a part could lead to a complex chain of different tool changes and settings.&#x20;

### Fusion 360 CAM

Fusion 360 has an advanced integrated CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing) suite offering a smooth transition from CAD design to machining operations. Below is a video for some of the more relevant operations home CNC users may come across.

### Easel

Easel is a browser-based CAM software primarily for 2D CNC operations and mild 3D contour machining. It is by far the easiest CAM software to get started in, the UI is clean and simple, and the steps are extremely straightforward. The only downside is that it offers only a 30-day free trial. However, we encourage new users to utilize this 30-day free trial to learn the basics of CNC machining before trying out other CAM programs!

### Estlcam

Estlcam is a completely free open-source CAM software specifically for milling operations. We have had a relatively good experience as new users with Estlcam, it is by far the closest CAM software to Easel. However unlike Easel, it is not browser-based, it's completely free, and its UI is a little messier. We think Estlcam is a good CAM suite for intermediate CNC users like ourselves.&#x20;

### Open Builds CONTROL

Open Builds Control is another great open-sourced CNC milling CAM suite we have used before. The greatest advantage of Open Builds Control is probably the larger community support for both the hardware and software. This software was community-developed to complement a variety of open-sourced CNC machines. Open Builds Control has by far the cleanest UI for a free CAM software, but learning the software will take some time due to its many parameters.
