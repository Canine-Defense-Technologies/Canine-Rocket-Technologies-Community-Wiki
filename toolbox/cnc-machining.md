# CNC Machining

Computer Numerical Control Machining or CNC is a method of automated machining through computer controlled tools. CNC Machining is what we call Subtractive Manufacturing, where

#### When Should I Use CNC Machining?

CNC machining is neither the most efficient nor most elegant manufacturing process. It takes a lot of time, material, and skill. However it often yields extremely strong consistent parts compared. WE often try to avoid CNC machining due to the time and cost, but when part reliability and strength are critical, its often the best manufacturing method to go with.&#x20;
