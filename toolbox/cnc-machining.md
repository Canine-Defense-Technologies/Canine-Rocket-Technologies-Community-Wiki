# CNC Machining

Computer Numerical Control Machining or CNC is a method of automated machining through computer controlled tools. CNC Machining is what we call Subtractive Manufacturing, where parts are cut out of larger blocks of material. This is fundamentally a wasteful and time consuming process hence the high costs.

#### When Should I Use CNC Machining?

Though CNC machining is neither the most efficient nor elegant manufacturing process, it often yields extremely strong consistent parts compared other novel manufacturing processes such as 3D printing. We often try to avoid CNC machining due to the time and cost, but when part reliability and strength are critical, its often the best manufacturing method to go with.&#x20;

Disadvantaged of CNC Machining

Typically budgetary and time constraints along with part geometry will be the determining factor as to whether CNC machining a part is feasible. Much like how some part geometries simply must be designed in certain ways to be 3D printed, the same applies for CNC machined parts but with even greater restrictions. Anyone mildly experience with CNC machining will realize how simple additions of features in a part could lead to a complex chain of different tool changes and settings.&#x20;
