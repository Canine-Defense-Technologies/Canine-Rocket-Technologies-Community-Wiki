# Composite Layups

Composite Layups are a great way to make extremely strong yet lightweight parts.&#x20;



## Safety

Respitory:

&#x20;Recent studies have suggested that dust particles from Carbon Fiber and other composites can cause very similiar effects as Aebetos. In short you really do not want to breath of the fibers or dusts in, they can lead to serious respirtory issues (And lung cancer). Not only is loose fibers and composite dust of concern, epoxy fumes can cause lung irriation and brain damage over long exposures. Always wear a repsirator when working with composites and do it in a well vetilated area (Preferably outdoors where the dust partiulates can be diluted into the enviroemnt naturally)

Skin Contact:&#x20;

Composite fibers and dust can irriate skin. Alothough less serious than lung damage, it is extremely irriating with the effect lasting for very long times (We had incidents where we had itchy skin for over a week, its not fun trust us!). Always wear disposable gloves when handling composites, adn wear a fully body tyvek coverally during layup jobs!
