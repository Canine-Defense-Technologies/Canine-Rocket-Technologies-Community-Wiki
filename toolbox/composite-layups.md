# Composite Layups

## Introduction

Composite Layups are a great way to make extremely strong yet lightweight parts. The basic concept is binding high tensile strength woven fibers with high compressive strength epoxy resins to form extremley stiff, lightweaight, and strong parts. Composi

## Safety

{% hint style="danger" %}
Ensure you use proper PPE and responsibly operate in manageable environments! Composites can cause cancer and respiratory illness if handled improperly!

#### Respiratory

&#x20;Recent studies have suggested that dust particles from Carbon Fiber and other composites can cause very similar effects as Asbestos. In short, you really do not want to breathe any of the fibers or dust in, they can lead to serious respiratory issues (And lung cancer). Not only are loose fibers and composite dust of concern, but epoxy fumes can also cause lung irritation and brain damage. Always wear a respirator when working with composites and do it in a well-ventilated area (Preferably outdoors where the dust particulates can be diluted into the environment naturally)

#### Skin Contact

Composite fibers and dust can irritate the skin. Although less serious than lung damage, it is extremely irritating with the effect lasting for very long times (We had incidents where we had itchy skin for over a week, it's not fun trust us!). Always wear disposable gloves when handling composites, and wear a full-body Tyvek coveralls during layup jobs!

## Easy Composites Video Series

Easy Composites is well known for their excellent composite layup videos! What's really awesome is how they cover techniques utilized in enterprise settings down to more hobbyist scale projects. If your interested in getting into composites or would like to simply learn the basics, we highly recommend you to check out the playlist below.&#x20;

## Composite Layup Record

The CLR is our universal documentation sheet to keep track of all the parameters of your composite layup. It allows your job to be recorded to be replicated in the future, or troubleshoot issues that may arise.&#x20;
