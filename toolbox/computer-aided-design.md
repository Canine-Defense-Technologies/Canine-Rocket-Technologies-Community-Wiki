# Computer Aided Design

Computer Aided Design or CAD is a software suite that allows designers to digitally draft their designs in a virtual workspace. CAD serves as the central hub between the design and manufacturing process. In modern hardware development, CAD has become the heart of. For anyone interested in CAD&#x20;

## Fusion 360

Fusion 360 is our primary CAD suite we use for designing, rendering, an

### F360 in Hardware Development&#x20;



### What F360 is NOT

Fusion 360 is NOT an engineering specific software. F360 does share many engineering features with Autodesk Inventor. Inventor was catered specificalyl for engineering. Based on more experienced people with sufficient experience with both software suite, F360 will lacks more technical features required in advanced engineering. This does not mean F360 is not for engineering, its more of a general design software suite that includes engineering as a sub dicpline. In general, Fusion 360 was highly catered for product deisgners (which conseuqntly will reqire engineering applications). This means fusion 360 retains a good balance of features and tools for integration and fabrciation of your design into manufatcuring processes, basic anylisis and calcuations, and (this is the product design part) a great suite of tools for asthetic works and renders.

### F360 Student License

If your a student like us, Fusion 360 is free to use after sumbititng proof of enrollment! We highly reccomend you to take this oppurintinty since the education license offers the entire osftware suite at no cost.

### F360 Hobbyist License

If your no longer a student, Autodesk offers a personal use F360 license with some limmitted features. It offers the full feldged design features, so it isn't a total deal breaker. However features like simulations, pcb design, and tehcnical drawings are completley gone or very limmited. This may make this a deal breaker for people intending to use this for more

## Learning Fusion 360

### Product Design Online

Product design online offers both paid and free online CAD courses regarding Fusion 360. Everyone has different learning styles, and their tutorials may not work for you, but in our experience (and based on our learning style) it was one of the best Fusion 360 courses out there. We highly recommend new CAD users to check out their 30 min Fusion 360 crash course (It got us up and running on Fusion 360 very quickly)

### Autodesk Fusion 360 Course

Frankly in our opinon at least, the Autodesk Fusion 360 Course is not nessarily the best structured tutorial for new users. We found the overall course to be a bit lengthy with emphasis on steps that anyone even midly experienced with most softwares would  be farimilr with. To be fair, Autodesk had to adopt this format assuming some of the users will not have any prior digtial knwodlege. Our suggestion for this is to skip or skim over overly ovbious steps and move on quickly. Some users may find the Autodesk course helpful, in our opinion it serves as a great didactic tool to learn more features/processes from intermediate users.&#x20;
