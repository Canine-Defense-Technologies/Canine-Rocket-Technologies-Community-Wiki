# Open HD 1



Open HD is an extremely capable community-run project that allows high-definition video, bidirectional UAV telemetry, audio, and RC control signals all through COTS single-board computers and Wi-Fi cards. We have used Open HD extensively both in bench testing, our electro-optic projects, and Unmanned Aerial System projects. Without Open HD, we would have had to spend a lot of time relying on clunky analog video stream systems, or expensive unreliable low latency digital video streams. It's an extremely incredible project with good documentation and an active community!
