# VESC 1

The VESC is one of the most underrated open projects in our opinion. It is the ultimate brushless motor driver project, pushing the boundaries of squeezing the maximum performance out of brushless motors with just the drivers; employing clever controller design and software. We've been exploring VESC for our range of projects including the possibility of near-silent electric propulsion systems just by clever hardware implementation on the VESC platform.&#x20;

## Real-world Demo

Benjamin Vedder is the creator and lead developer of VESC (Vedder ESC), and his channel is packed with technical information and demos. Watch his videos to learn more about some of the mind-blowing control of brushless motors he can manage just through software
