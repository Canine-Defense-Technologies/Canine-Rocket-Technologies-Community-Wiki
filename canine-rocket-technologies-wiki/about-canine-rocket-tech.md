# About Canine Defense Tech

### "Evolving problems requires open technologies. We will expand the technological capabilities of Americans abroad."

Winning back the American Tech Sector can not be attained through expensive large-scale developments like the past. The move foward must be through the rapid deployment of low-cost, open-source systems. During his middle school years in 2018, David a.k.a “Yukon” founded Canine Rocket Technologies as a project to begin self-learning the basics of advanced model rocketry. The scope of the projects gradually expanded to various defense technologies. Today Canine Defense Technologies is a multi-disciplinary hardware engineering company focused on tactical communication and flight system technologies. Our ever-growing work range from tactical radios, drone technology, rocketry sub-systems, underwater robotics, body armor carriers, and more. We will expand the technological capabilities of Americans abroad through the rapid development and deployment of open source technologies.
