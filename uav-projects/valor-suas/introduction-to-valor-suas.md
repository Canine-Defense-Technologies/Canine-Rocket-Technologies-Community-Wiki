# Introduction to Valor sUAs

Valor sUAS is an advanced stealthy quadcopter designed to serve as a multi-mission tool in tactical environments, search and rescue operations, general surveillance, payload delivery, etc. The system consists of the rugged UAV, Spot-T optics pod, field controller, battery charger, and ground station. Unlike commercially available systems every part of the system is modular, built using commercially available low-cost parts, and designed under an open architecture. This allows Valor to quickly and dynamically adapt to virtually any mission requirement.

At its core Valor, sUAS can offer a real-time First Person View (FPV) Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) feed to multiple operators on the ground with its advanced SPOT-T optics pod. Valor can simultaneously carry out secondary missions by carrying optional payload modules that simply snap into place.

### What Makes Valor sUAS Different?

There are many drone systems out there, why make another one? What makes this one special?

_**Low cost:**_ The whole system uses commercial off-the-shelf parts, it's much cheaper to build or repair compared to commercial solutions! The total R\&D cost of Valor was less than a comparable commercial solution, and mass production of this system means the price can be dropped even further.&#x20;

_**Ultra modular:**_  Payloads can snap onto the outside of the UAV by common standard connectors and thumbscrews: all internal structural and electronic components are easily accessible and replaceable! Want to power Valor UAV with hydrogen fuel cells? Design a new pod that slides under its belly rail. Want Valor UAV to be tethered with power and data? Add a module to the integrated side payload rails! But this isn't just for the UAV, the ground support equipment all operates off of open standards and hardware, so designing new terminals and ground stations catered to specific missions is extremely easy to do!

_**Future proof:**_  Another benefit of ultra modularity! Drone airframes and ground support equipment haven't changed much over the years, but drone payloads change at a rapid pace! One of the technologies that change rapidly over the years is cameras and radios. The SPOT Optics Pod, Payloads, and Radio suite (On the UAV and on the ground) can all be upgraded very easily as the technology matures!

_**Designed not only for the air but also for the ground:**_ IR strobes, laser designators, IR illuminators, optional radio repeaters, video streams capable of streaming to multiple ground video terminals, a ground station that connects to multiple user devices on the ground; the Valor Unmanned Aerial System easily interoperates with people on the ground!&#x20;

_**Full user FPV Immersion:**_  Typically a UAV can only stream video to a single operator. The operator is then responsible for relaying this FPV information to other operators on the ground. Often this involves the archaic process of relaying what is seen to the operator via voice communications which can lead to confusion and other issues. Another method is streaming the video to multiple terminals. This involves streaming the FPV video to the ground station, then networking that information to a field server. This is complicated and adds latency. How Valor sUAS solves this is with a direct link to every ground FPV video viewing asset negating the need for complex networking.&#x20;
