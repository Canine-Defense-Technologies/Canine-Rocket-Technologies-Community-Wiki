# Valor sUAS

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/HGN0yWIqCG8" %}

Valor sUAS is an advanced stealthy quadcopter designed to serve as a multi-mission tool in tactical environments, search and rescue operations, general surveillance, payload delivery, etc. The system consists of the rugged UAV, Spot-T optics pod, field controller, battery charger, and ground station. Unlike commercially available systems every part of the system is modular, built using commercially available low-cost parts, and designed under an open architecture. This allows Valor to quickly and dynamically adapt to virtually any mission requirement.

At its core Valor, sUAS can offer a real-time First Person View (FPV) Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) feed to multiple operators on the ground with its advanced SPOT-T optics pod. Valor can simultaneously carry out secondary missions by carrying optional payload modules that simply snap into place.
