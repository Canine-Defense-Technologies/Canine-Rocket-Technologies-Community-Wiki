# FAQ

### How do you work on a collaborative basis with other students, and how can I collaborate?

A lot of my collaborations are done privately. There are a handful of students and friends I work with on a daily basis, whether it’s advising each based on our experience, mailing each other parts, working on a group project, etc. I’m also active in open source projects such as Meshtastic. I wish I could collaborate with as many people as I can, but it can be quite challenging being a student. I have attempted to form a public collaborative group, but I ended up spending more time on management rather than actual hardware development. For now, I'm sticking to already great collaborative platforms that exist and are managed by great people.

### Why is (insert name here) project not open-sourced?

There are two reasons: It’s had issues so I redacted them temporarily, or I think it was far more responsible to do so. Since active development of systems in beta is essentially tested and shared among my peers, and I don’t have the time to manage a whole public R\&D project, I don’t share the project files when I find an issue, The last thing I want is for someone to assemble my open source project and met with a catastrophic failure. Realistically though it still happens, though with careful internal testing and version control it can be mitigated. When my users do report issues, I fix them and release a new version as quickly as possible. Now as for other projects, I think it’s self-explanatory. Because of ITAR and it generally being stupid to post more sensitive things online, I simply think it’s far more responsible to not open source some rocket/drone hardware.

​

### What (Insert tool & software name here) do you use?

Just because I use these things doesn't mean it’s good. There are many options for a given software or tool for a reason, so different users can cater to their needs as they want. As you probably noticed, I love open-sourced ecosystems and try to stay away from proprietary systems.
