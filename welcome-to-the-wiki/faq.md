# FAQ

### Why is it named “Canine”

Who doesn't like dogs (dogs are better than cats)? From wolves to working dogs, they’re tough and useful creatures. It’s interesting how one metric of technological advancement is observing how much animal labor is used, and as advanced as we are now we still use dogs to save lives on a daily basis. That’s the kind of technology I want to work on. As an added bonus, it’s a catchier name than the cliche project or company names you're accustomed to, the idea came from John Carmack’s Armadillo Aerospace. I thought it was unique and fun and somewhat more relatable than (choose astronomy name) and (slap "aerospace", "technology", "defense", etc.)

### How do you work on a collaborative basis with other students, and how can I collaborate?

A lot of my collaborations are done privately. There are a handful of students and friends I work with on a daily basis, whether it’s advising each based on our experience, mailing each other parts, working on a group project, etc. I’m also active in open source projects such as Meshtastic. I wish I could collaborate with as many people as I can, but it can be quite challenging being a student. I have attempted to form a public collaborative group, but I ended up spending more time on management rather than actual hardware development. For now, I'm sticking to already great collaborative platforms that exist and are managed by great people.

### Why is (insert name here) project not open-sourced?

There are two reasons: It’s had issues so I redacted them temporarily, or I think it was far more responsible to do so. Since active development of systems in beta is essentially tested and shared among my peers, and I don’t have the time to manage a whole public R\&D project, I don’t share the project files when I find an issue, The last thing I want is for someone to assemble my open source project and met with a catastrophic failure. Realistically though it still happens, though with careful internal testing and version control it can be mitigated. When my users do report issues, I fix them and release a new version as quickly as possible. Now as for other projects, I think it’s self-explanatory. Because of ITAR and it generally being stupid to post more sensitive things online, I simply think it’s far more responsible to not open source some rocket/drone hardware.

​

### What (Insert tool & software name here) do you use?

Just because I use these things doesn't mean it’s good. There are many options for a given software or tool for a reason, so different users can cater to their needs as they want. As you probably noticed, I love open-sourced ecosystems and try to stay away from proprietary systems.
