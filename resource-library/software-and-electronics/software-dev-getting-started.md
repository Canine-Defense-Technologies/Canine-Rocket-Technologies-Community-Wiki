## Getting Started with Programming on an Arduino

As previously said with C++, it has a quite large learning curve that requires a lot of previous knowledge about how a computer works, how C works, how C++ works, etc., etc. But given one step at a time, it is significantly easier to learn with the Arduino framework than to go into the wild west of C++ programming.

If you're a total beginner stuck with an Arduino with no way to program it, no fear! This tutorial is for you. We here at Canine Rocket Technologies have had our own first experiences with Arduino. It isn't pretty, but it got us where we are now. Stick with us, we don't bite (too hard)!
