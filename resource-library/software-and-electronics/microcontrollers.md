# Microcontrollers

## Introduction

Microcontrollers are small but powerful computers for many purposes, one of which is powering our projects. They are compressed into Integrated Circuit (IC) packages, so it is easier to design a small project. What is neat about them is that they are a functioning computer in one package. A processor, RAM, and flash memory are all compressed into one chip. All that's needed is power, some code, and a clock. So, in theory, it can do a lot of things.

Many microcontrollers from different brands feature different specifications, sizes, and even different communication methods. It can be very hard to choose one for a project sometimes, so don't be overwhelmed while searching for a microcontroller. There are many popular choices to choose from for different needs. Below are some good starting points to use for those still searching.

## Arduino

The Arduino ecosystem is undoubtedly one of the easiest introductions into the world of microcontrollers. They are very simple machines but they can do many things given the code, tools, and expertise. Arduino-based microcontrollers were designed to be easy to use. And paired with the helpful and thoughtful Arduino community, it is very possible to do almost any task on Arduino microcontrollers.

There are many places online to purchase kits that come with an Arduino microcontroller and even some cool things to plug into it. Things like LEDs, buzzers, sensors, buttons, you name it, are in a kit. Good kits on Amazon can go for under $100 USD, and are a great place to start for beginners.

Here is a great link from the creators of Arduino on how and why Arduino works the way it does.
