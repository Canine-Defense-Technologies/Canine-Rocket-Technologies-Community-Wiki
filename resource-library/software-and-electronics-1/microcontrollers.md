# Microcontrollers

## Introduction

Microcontrollers are what act as the brains on a lot of our projects. Microcontrollers are essentially compact ICs (integrated Circuits) with a small processor, inputs and outputs, and memory all packed into a tiny chip. They're not full-blown computers like those that are able to display an operating system but are much rather designed to be compact, power efficient, and simple and robust enough to continuously run and control a system. Microcontrollers are programmable via different standards, but they all follow the same principles. There are a variety of standaerdized packages and ecoystsmes micrcontrollers fall under, so doing your own research can be overwhelming. Nowdays there are many community supproted ecoystems that cater to different levels of expertises, and the majority of these systems will be sufficient in satifuing the majoritiy of applications. For your conveinance, we have listed some great starting points below.

## Arduino

The Arduino ecosystem is probably one of the easiest introductions into the world of microcontrollers. It's the perfect place to start for new users looking to learn how to use a microcontroller since it was designed to be easy to use and has a massive online community with millions of users that follows. They take in the C++ codes and runs them in a loop, and with the help of a variety of controllers and sensor breakouts, it can carry out a lot of tasks. The best way to learn Arduino is to find an interesting project and replicating it. The first project most people do is make a LED blink. There are also a lot of great starter kits you can purchase online.
