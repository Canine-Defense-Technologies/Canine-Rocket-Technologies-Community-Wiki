{% embed url="https://youtu.be/qz2P9celU1M" %}

The Pinouts Book is an extremely awesome project by hacker [N-O-D-E](https://n-o-d-e.net/index.html), its a concentrated in-depth (yet extremely simple to view) quick reference book of every major pinout you will encounter during your electronics development project. We found this to be one of the best handbook references to have around when integrating electronics.
