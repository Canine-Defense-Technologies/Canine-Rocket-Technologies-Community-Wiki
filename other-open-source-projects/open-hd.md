# Open HD

Open HD is an extremely awesome community run project that allows high definition video, bidirectional UAV telemetry, audio, and RC control signals all through COTS single board computers and wifi cards. We have used Open HD extensively both in bench testing, our electro optic projects, and Unmanned Aerial System projects. Without Open HD, we would have had to spend a lot of timre relying on clunky anaolog video stream systems, or expensive unrelaible low latency digital video st Its an extremely incredible project with good documentation and an active community!
