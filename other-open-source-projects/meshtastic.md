# Meshtastic&#x20;

Meshtastic is one of our favorite open source projects! Our contributions have been small, but due to being huge fans of this project we have jumped on board as hardware developers. Meshtastic is a LoRa radio and GPS based mesh communicator project allowing completely decentralized encrypted communication. The possibilities of its potential applications are endless!&#x20;

### Meshtastic ATAK Plugin

Another sub community project of Meshtastic is the ATAK forwarder, a project that allows Meshtastic comms to be forwarded and viewed via ATAK. This capability has been an extremely simple way to give our projects simple ATAK integration!
