# Night Vision Basics

## Introduction

At K-Tech we've been playing around, developing, and contributing to multiple night vision projects. Night vision technology may be many decades old, but still is relevant to this day. If your developing night vision or have interest in it, here are some resource we found immensely helpful with getting started.
