{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ks4Oo0Oxe4" %}

K-TAK RTE-1 (Ruggedized T-Beam Enclosure 1) is an open-sourced ruggedized tactical enclosure for the t beam m8. With the recent ATAK forwarder project, there has been more interest in applying Meshtastic to tactical scenarios, and this is the first enclosure designed specifically for such use cases. RTE-1 was designed around a large battery compartment ensuring space for a high-capacity battery; this will allow days of continuous operation on a single charge. It also utilizes commercially available waterproof components to offer a weatherproof and completely sealed body, protecting the electronics from the elements. Though not a beginner-friendly project, RTE-1 is relatively a simple construction. The body is 3D printed with cnc cutout "armor" panels for added protection and strength.
