# Composite Layups

Composite Layups are a great way to make extremely strong yet lightweight parts.&#x20;



## Safety

{% hint style="danger" %}
Ensure you use proper PPE and responsibly operate in manageable environments! Composites can cause cancer and respiratory illness if dealt with incorrectly!&#x20;
{% endhint %}

#### Respiratory

&#x20;Recent studies have suggested that dust particles from Carbon Fiber and other composites can cause very similar effects as Asbestos. In short, you really do not want to breathe of the fibers or dust in, they can lead to serious respiratory issues (And lung cancer). Not only are loose fibers and composite dust of concern, but epoxy fumes can also cause lung irritation and brain damage over long exposures. Always wear a respirator when working with composites and do it in a well-vetilated area (Preferably outdoors where the dust particulates can be diluted into the environment naturally)

#### Skin Contact

Composite fibers and dust can irritate the skin. Although less serious than lung damage, it is extremely irritating with the effect lasting for very long times (We had incidents where we had itchy skin for over a week, it's not fun trust us!). Always wear disposable gloves when handling composites, and wear a full-body Tyvek coveralls during layup jobs!

## K-Tech Composite Layup Record (CLR)

The CLR is our universal documentation sheet to keep track of all the parameters of your composite layup. It allows your job to be recorded to be replicated in the future, or troubleshoot issues that may arise.&#x20;
