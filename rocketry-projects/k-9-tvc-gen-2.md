K-9 TVC Gen 2 is the next generation of our TVC gimbal development employing a radically new approach. Generation 2 employed the "half mount" design, which allows the user to very easily align the mount perfectly centered without the need for jigs or complex tooling. It also allowed for a full carbon fiber reinforced version, the first TVC gimbal to be fabricated in this method for its kind.&#x20;
