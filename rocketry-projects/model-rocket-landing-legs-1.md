K-9 Landing Leg system is an open-source landing leg system designed to soften impact at the landing and keep your vehicle upright. I have gotten numerous requests for these files, and after a lot of testing and redesign, it is finally out! The system is capable of withstanding impacts from 1-2 meters. Our tested data showed the legs surviving an impact up to a maximum AGL height of 25 feet or 7.6 meters. It deploys by any band around the leg being cut with nichrome wire. The deployment is controlled by the pyro output of your rocket's flight computer.
