K-9 TVC Gimbal MEGA was an experimental project to try and develop a possible TVC solution for much larger model rocket motors. Overall the project scope was more of a conceptual prototype to explore the possibilities of large-form TVC gimbal systems. We hope to revisit this project sometime in the future.&#x20;
