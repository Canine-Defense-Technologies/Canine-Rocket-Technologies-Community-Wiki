Meshtastic is an open-source, off-grid, decentralized, mesh network built to run on affordable, low-power devices. It allows users to share geolocation data, text messages, and more through LoRa radios into an integrated mesh radio to extend and effectively merge the outreach of the network. Applications range from emergency communication, off-the-grid communication, DIY tactical networks, and more. We employ this technology and system in many of our own projects.&#x20;

### Meshtastic ATAK Plugin

Another sub-community project of Meshtastic is the ATAK forwarder, a project that allows Meshtastic comms to be forwarded and viewed via ATAK. This capability has been an extremely simple way to give our projects simple ATAK integration to build out your own tactical communication network.
