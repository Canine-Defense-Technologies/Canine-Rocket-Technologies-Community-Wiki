# Radio/Optic Line of Sight Tools

Much like how optics can only observe objects in the line of sight, many radio devices follow the same principle. However, unlike optics, radio waves can bounce off of different surfaces, and penetrate through objects. These unique phenomena are varied primarily by what frequency range the radios are operating, and many other variables. Whether you're making your own communication network, building a radio-controlled vehicle, etc. it is generally a good rule to try and make your radio devices be in line of sight. Listed below are some great tools to visualize and simulate topography-based line of sight for radios and optic projects.&#x20;

## HeyWhatsThat

HeyWhatsThat is a free online radio line-of-sight tool. It can be beneficial for planning out the placement of long-range optics and radio equipment. There's not much to it, add in the exact location and the elevation offset, and it will indicate the location of every point in a full 360 radius on where Line Of Sight can be achieved. It's a popular tool among radio enthusiasts who are trying to break transmission records and people setting up their own communication networks.&#x20;

## RF Line of Sight

This is a simple and easy-to-use tool by Scadacore. Simply place the two pin-points or type in the coordinates, and it will offer a very simple topography slice to visualize the line of sight between the two points. This tool is great for quick point-to-point calculations when a full 360 view calculation like HeyWhatsThat is necessary.&#x20;
