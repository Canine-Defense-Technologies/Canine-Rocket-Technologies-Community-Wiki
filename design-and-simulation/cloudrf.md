# CloudRF

CloudRF is a radio propogation anylsis tool. CloudRF will help you to determine the precise coverage of your radio device for design analysis, route or mission planning, and general environmental assessments. CloudRF is developer friendly and can even integrate toa applications such as ATAK. CloudRF is a paid service, but they also offer a limited free plan that offers up to 1 GHz in frequency with the max range locked at 5 km. We found this to be sufficient for most applications.&#x20;
