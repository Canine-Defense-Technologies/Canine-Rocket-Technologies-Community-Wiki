# Radio Line of Sight Tools

Much like how you can only see something in the line of sight of you, many radio devices follow the same principle. However&#x20;



HeyWhatsThat is a free online radio line-of-sight tool. It can be very useful for planning out the placement of long-range optics and radio equipment. There's not much to it, add in the exact location and the elevation offset, and it will indicate the location of every point in a full 360 radius on where Line Of Sight can be achieved. It's a popular tool among radio enthusiasts who are trying to break transmission records and people setting up their own communication networks.&#x20;
